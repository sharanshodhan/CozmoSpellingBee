Cozmo Robots 

This is a spelling bee game with three cozmo robots synced over the network. 

The objective of the game is to help your cozmo robot spell out words using Morse Code. It is a turn-based game with a judge cozmo giving out words and giving feedback on whether the spelling was correct or not. The cozmos are synced using a Node.js server and all three cozmos can interact with each other. A Web User Interface shows the players an image corresponding to the word as a clue to what word needs to be spelled out. the web UI also shows the players currently playing and their scores. Each player gets three lives and the last remaining player is the winner. To make the game more fun, special levels such as "spelling the word backwards" and "spelling the word without any vowels" were also added. This game turned out to be super fun with people of all ages and the fact that it required no human intervention made the user feel immersed in the cozmo world.
